# Ayora Portfolio

 This is my personal developer portfolio built with React and Vite.  
I made this website to showcase the projects I’ve worked on, the skills I’m learning, and my progress as a software development student.

It includes sections like **About Me**, **Projects**, and **Contact**, so anyone visiting can see what I’ve done and what I’m learning.  
The site is fully responsive and deployed online for easy access.

I built this portfolio as part of my journey to improve my web development skills, practice React, and learn modern web development tools.  
I’m still learning, but I’m excited to keep improving and adding more projects here!
